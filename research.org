* Data Exploration                                                 :DATA:EXP:
  ** TODO determine how to calculate the information gain for all the
     numeric (and non numeric) fields that are present in the merged
     data set :DATA:EXP:
 ** TODO Calculate centroids for the spraying events on a given date
    and add those to the model :DATA:EXP:

* Data Imputation
  ** Weather:
  ** If the data was "  T" than the value of 0.001 was imputed :DATA:IMPUTE:
  ** if the data was "M" than the midpoint estimate was used (if a viable set of
  endpoints could be chosen, else, the value of NA was used) :DATA:MISSING:
** Barometric Pressure readings where substituted when NA with the nearest
station :DATA:IMPUTE:

* Notes:
** Traps were converted to Factors rather than strings
** Dates were converted to Date Factors rather than strings
** Mosquito Counts can not be included in the model because they are not available in the
test set... (they are a predicted quantity) :MODEL:RESTRICTION:
